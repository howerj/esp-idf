# pickle

From <https://github.com/howerj/pickle>.

This is an interpreter for a TCL like language.

# To Do

- Find best way to integrate this into the project (both in terms of the build
  system, pulling from the source repository, optional build extras, ...).
- Add command line options from other applications
- Add optional build requirements for optional tools
  - For things like the file system, time, starting and interacting with other
    components...
- Put in pull request for this module
- Reuse components in 'system/console' to add some functionality to this
  module. It might actually make more sense to merge the example shell with
  that console module than in creating a new module.
- Start a separate task for the shell.
